hard limit, but should be generally respected.

## Introduction

The Apothecary is a chill and welcoming left-leaning community, a minority friendly space, a place
of self-expression. The community is heavily moderated for the safety and comfort of our members, if
that's not something you're comfortable with, this isn't the space for you. Be respectful of others,
even those you don't understand.

## Content

There is specific and strict content policy on this server, for the protection of our members.

### Guidelines

- Engage with one another in good faith (especially in the politics room)
- Respect boundaries as placed by others
- Be respectful/apologize/give space as necessary if someone tells you, or implies through their actions, that you crossed a boundary
- Be tolerant of other people's views, as long as they are not harmful `[wording?]`
- Spoiler content that may be unpleasant or triggering
- Disagreements happen, but don't let it turn into an argument. Listen if someone tells you to drop it `[wording?]`
- Keep discussion topical to the room it's in and migrate elsewhere if needed

## Disallowed conduct

    - Racism

## Politics

Political topics and discussions should be kept to the Politics room.
What counts as a political topic is up to moderator discression.


## Mental Health

Any content which mentions heavy mental health topics, such as suicide and self harm, must be kept
to the Vent rooms and spoilered appropriately.


## Action
Moderators may choose how to deal with unacceptable behaviour. Here is a non-exhaustive list of things they may do:

- Inform the offender that their actions were unacceptable and should not be repeated.
- Temporarily restrict the offender's ability to send messages.
- Temporarily or permanently ban the offender from the service.


## Scope
These community guidelines apply to all rooms and spaces related to the the-apothecary.club
homeserver and related services.
